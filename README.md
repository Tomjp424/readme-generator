## Description
An easy-to-use, lightweight application for quickly generating professional README files for projects. Prompts the user for various pieces of information such as the title of their project, descriptions, and so on, then uses that information to generate a README files where all relevant sections are divided properly.

## Installation
Download the application from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Tomjp424/readme-generator). Done. It really is that easy.

## Usage
Navigate to `/readme-generator/Develop` within your Git Bash terminal, or open it with your preferred IDE and use the integrated terminal. First, you'll need to install inquirer. Simply enter the command `npm i` or `npm install` and it will install inquirer for you automatically. Then, enter the command `node index.js` into the terminal and press enter. You will now be prompted with a series of question. If at any point you would like to add images to a section, you can either provide a URL if the image is hosted on the internet, or create a folder within the repository to place your images into, then provide paths to them. Once all questions are answered properly, you should receive a message within the terminal saying `README generated successfully!`. The generated README (Titled `YourREADME.md` to avoid confusion) will be located in that same `/Develop` directory. Click [here](https://youtu.be/lNTUnK537m4) for a video demonstration.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the application, you're more than welcome to download the repository and modify it how you see fit. If you develop it further and would like to have your changes integrated into the main repository, reach out to me at my contacts below and I can review your additions.

## Testing
There isn't much variance in the functionality of the application. I suppose if you need a sample README to test off of, you can use this one.
